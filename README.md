# Structure
## Aim - Write a C Program to implement structure.
### Description - Structure is a user-defined datatype in C language which allows us to combine data of different types together. Structure helps to construct a complex data type . It is similar to an Array, but an array holds data of similar type only. But structure on the other hand, can store data of any type, which is practical more useful.
